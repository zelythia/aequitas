# About

In Minecraft, everything is made out of a special essence. With Aequitas you are able to freely exchange this essence and convert every item into other items using Crafting and Sampling Pedestals.

You are also able to collect the essence using special Collection Bowl and create items from "nothing". 

The Essence is also a powerful and mythical resource and can be crafted into powerful armor and tools.
